# TRAN5340M Transport Data Science Coursework
This repository contains my work as part of the TRAN5340M Transport Data Science module under the Institute of Transport Studies of University of Leeds. Students are free to choose any topic within the domain of transport and demonstrate various transport data science skills learned in this module to address the topic. My topic is "Enhancing Road Safety for Pedestrians and Cyclists in Leeds". This topic is relevant in many ways. First, in the past few years, the UK Government has been promoting more active modes of travel such as walking and cycling, so making the roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists would naturally encourage an uptake. Second, any efforts to address their safety will help to save lives. Third, it will also contribute towards a safer road culture. Although the code had been designed with Leeds as the area of study and 2014-2018 as the period of study, it is reproducible and scalable for not only other geographical regions and longer time periods.
